<h2> What is Sustainable Development? </h2>

<u> <font color="black"> <strong> <em> "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the presnt, without compromising the ability of future generations to met their own needs". </em> </strong> </front> </u>
<br>

<font colour="black" width="+2"><p> The concept of sustainable development can be interpreted in many different ways, but at its core is an approach to development that looks to balance different, and often competing, needs against an awareness of the environmental, social andeconomic limitations we face as a society. </p></font>

<br>
<p> All too often, development is driven by one particular need, without folly concidering the wider of future impacts. We are already seeing the damage this kind of approach can cause, from large-scale financial crisescaused by irresponsible bnking, to changes in global climate resulting from our dependence on fossil fuel-based energy sources. The longer we pursue unsustainable development, the more frequent and serve its consequences arelikelyto become, which is why we need to take action now. </p>
